How AuditAI Works – Practical Use Case for Law Firms
====================================================

🎯 Common office scenario:
A client walks into the law firm bringing various documents:

- Contracts (service agreements, rental, commercial partnerships)
- Terms of use from digital platforms
- Chat screenshots (WhatsApp, email)
- Invoices and bills
- Extrajudicial notifications
- Suspicious website links

✅ What AuditAI does with this:

1. Uploading documents
The lawyer or intern scans and uploads all files into the AuditAI system through a secure web interface (login via Firebase + reCAPTCHA).

2. Automated AI analysis
The text content is processed by a language model (LLM – Gemini Pro), which identifies:

- Offensive or discriminatory language (useful in labor lawsuits or moral damages)
- Abusive or missing clauses (e.g., lack of jurisdiction or responsibility limits)
- Legal inconsistencies in contracts
- Suspicious or phishing URLs
- Mismatches between contract and billing (Fiserv parser on invoice or statement)

3. Actionable results
The system organizes insights by risk type, severity, and suggested action:

| Risk Type             | Severity | Document         | Suggested Action            |
|-----------------------|----------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Abusive Clause        | High     | contract1.pdf    | Request revision or legal action |
| Offensive Language    | Medium   | chat.jpeg        | Add to case file           |
| Overbilling           | High     | invoice_feb.png  | Challenge legally          |

4. Geographic visualization
If the document contains IP or location metadata, the system maps it (Mapbox). Useful for:

- Detecting scam patterns by region
- Connecting similar cases
- Presenting more visual evidence

5. Automatic history log
Each analysis is saved with:
- Document name
- User who uploaded
- Date/time
- AI result

This creates a record for:
- Internal review
- Client reports
- Drafting legal petitions

📌 Direct benefits for the law firm

- 🕒 Saves time: automated triage
- 🧠 Focus on strategy: lawyers work on what matters most
- 📊 Professionalism: structured and AI-backed delivery
- 🔍 Proactive detection of contractual or legal risks
- 🗂 Historical tracking and document standardization

📈 Practical example:
A service contract with a broad liability limitation clause is flagged by the AI as potentially null. This supports a case for strict liability against the contractor — a point that could have been missed manually.

Ideal for law firms aiming to scale client service while maintaining legal quality and efficiency.
