Fullstack Project for Professional Portfolio
=============================================

ðŸ“Œ Project Name:
AuditAI â€“ Intelligent Auditing and Content Analysis Platform

ðŸ§  Strategic Description:
AuditAI is a fullstack application that enables intelligent analysis of documents, messages, and URLs. It uses LLMs such as Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro to detect fraud patterns, contractual inconsistencies, legal risks, and offensive language. Itâ€™s ideal for HR, legal, and compliance teams. It includes secure authentication (OAuth 2.0 with Firebase), real-time updates via async API calls (WebSocket), a visual dashboard with geographic map (Mapbox), and an audit history stored in Firestore. It also integrates reCAPTCHA for security and financial statement parsing using a Fiserv mock.

ðŸŽ¯ Alignment with Technical Requirements:
This project covers all key technical requirements for a modern fullstack developer role, including:

- TypeScript on the frontend (Angular) and backend (NestJS)
- Redux-like state management (NgRx or Signal Store)
- Custom Webpack configuration
- REST APIs with OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
- Asynchronous API calls with WebSocket
- Authentication and database via Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage
- Geographic visualization with Mapbox
- Integrations with LLM (Gemini), Fiserv (mock), and Google reCAPTCHA
- Testing with Jest and Cypress
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Demonstrates modular architecture, technical leadership, SOLID principles, and PR/documentation best practices

âœ… Conclusion
With this stack, you can deliver all of AuditAIâ€™s features without spending a single dollar:

- Frontend: Angular + Tailwind (Vercel or Netlify)
- Backend: NestJS + Gemini Pro (Vercel or Render)
- Auth + Storage + DB: Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Storage)
- Map: Mapbox
- Testing: Jest + Cypress
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- LLM: Gemini Pro Free Tier
